    "        - **Capital structure arbitrage**: implied asset vol, residualizing against interest rate risk, delta risk, gamma risk, or even market-wide IV risk.\n",

    "## The Importance to look at clean signals\n",
    "- By clean signals, we mean signals that (1) are based on risk decomposition, and thus each signal residualizes against unwanted risks and (2) before all other orthogonal components that will impact final PnL, such as transaction costs, etc.\n",
    "- Looking at clean signals is **a way to divide-and-conquer**. There are three benefits.\n",
    "    - Gives a clear indication of what has/has not performed, and thus **directions to improve**.\n",
    "    - The smaller problem also **allows for easier solutions**: main point of divide and conquer.\n",
    "    - Can help find new opportunities, by **facilitating better mapping**.\n",
    "        - For instance, on an absolute scale, EM sovereign debts may not look attrative on its own or even its basis. But when considering EM hard currency debt and the local currency counterparts, the relative value signal may look attractive, and there could be entry points while the whole market's axes are lopsided. But this mapping would not have been easy without the compartmentation of delta vs vega risks."
