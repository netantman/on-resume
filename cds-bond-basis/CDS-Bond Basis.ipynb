    "At Barclays (or formerly Lehman Brothers), the basis is defined as CDS spread (to equivalent maturity) minus BCDS Spread. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "- Indutry standard may use the **Z-spread** in place of the BCDS spread, which is called 'raw spread' in Chapter 7 of [Morgan Stanley Credit Insights](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s191/nl/21353936/35eb5274-fadd-cea2-f38a-9275ffa755f7?title=Morgan%20Stanley%20Credit%20Insights%20(2015)). Since CDS recovery (and thus payoff) is with respect to par, traders may buy/sell more/less protection depending on the dollar price of the cash bonds. As such Chapter 7 of [Morgan Stanley Credit Insights](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s191/nl/21353936/35eb5274-fadd-cea2-f38a-9275ffa755f7?title=Morgan%20Stanley%20Credit%20Insights%20(2015)) adjust for the basis to reflect that, and arrives at an **adjusted basis**, which arguably is more executable than the raw basis.\n",
    "- Some may use **ASW spread** for fixed bonds and **par floater** spread for floating-rate bonds.\n",
    "- But Barclays argues **BCDS spread** makes more sense. In particular the **BCDS makes the dependence on recovery rate explicit**. \n",
    "    - Indeed, the Z spread does not take recovery assumption and acceleration of debt at default into consideration, while the bond-implied CDS spread is explicit about its recovery assumption as pricing the usual CDS spread: and depending on whether the bond is premium or discount, the relationship between BCDS and assumed recovery rate can be reversed; the effect means that even if the Z-spread of a discount bond is lower than the same-maturity CDS spread, the bond may still be cheap compared with the CDS. See discussion in the BCDS section in [returns-spread-yield](../../bond-math/returns-spreads-yields.ipynb). \n",
    "    - One can presumably extend the BCDS spread to adjust for dollar price of the bond too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the factors driving the basis, though some of them are probably artificial due to the usage of Z spread or OAS spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental reasons for **negative basis** (when CDS < bond spread $\\leftrightarrow$ bonds are relatively cheap)\n",
    "- *Funding*: CDS are implicitly funded at Fed Funds/OIS, through its synthetic nature and margin requirements. Bond are typically funded at Libor plus a (positive) spread. Thus bonds are more balance-sheet intensive, which tends to lead to higher bond spreads. But funding for bonds is usually hard: maintaining a long bond position over that horizon requires committing the purchase price of the bond for five years or borrowing the purchase price through repo for several years; similarly, maintaining a short bond position over a multi-year horizon would require finding a counterparty willing to lend that bond long term and face the risk that the bond would be needed, perhaps to raise funds, at some interim time. \n",
    "- *Leverage*: CDS risk margin may be lower than bond haircuts.\n",
    "- *Premium accrued at default*: Following a credit event, a CDS pays the protection seller the premium which has accrued since the previous payment date. However, when a bond defaults, the owner’s claim is on the face value, and so any accrued coupons are lost. The effect on the inclusion of coupon accrued on default is to lower the CDS spread and so reduce the basis. Even if a bondholder’s claim for accrued interest is recognized, the bond-holder will not receive the full amount but only the amount multiplied by the recovery rate. In contrast, in a standard CDS contract the protection seller will be paid the full premium accrued between the last payment date and the default event. This technicality will also bias CDS spread downward.\n",
    "- *Synthetic CDO technical short*: When dealers issue synthetic CDOs, they then hedge their spread risk by selling CDS credit protection on each of the 100 or more credits in the reference portfolio. CDO issuance is therefore usually accompanied by a tightening (reduction) in CDS spread.\n",
    "- *Default Correlation between counterparties*: the protection buyer is subject to the default correlation between the protection seller and the reference entity. This counterparty credit risk reduces the CDS premium that the protection buyer is willing to pay.\n",
    "- *Daycount convention*: a technicality. A CDS spread is based on the Actual/360 daycount convention, while for Z spread the market convention is 30/360 (same as corp cash bonds). This effect alone means that the CDS spread should be roughly 1.5bp lower than the Z-spread and OAS for each 100bp.\n",
    "- *Payment frequency*: another technicality. A CDS spread is based on quarterly payments. The market convention for Z-spread is semiannual compounding. One measure of the effect of the payment frequency is that a 100bp CDS with quarterly payments corresponds in value to a 100.7bp CDS with semi-annual payments and a 99.3bp CDS with continuous payments; that is, the higher frequency of payment bias CDS spread downward.\n",
    "- *Forced selling of bonds*. There are occasions where bonds are subject to forced selling while the corresponding CDS is not. \n",
    "    - For instance, fallen angels are excluded from the IG index and are subsequently sold by investors with constraints, such as insurance firms or some mutual funds. This forced selling will make bond artificially cheap for a while; see more detailed discussion on this topic in Chapters 2 and 3 of [Systematic Investing in Credit](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s191/nl/21353936/8739ce4a-eba6-3100-230f-b0bd8f70c427?title=Systematic%20Investing%20in%20Credit). \n",
    "    - For fallen angels, trading the bond-CDS basis is considered to be a better hedged version of the longing the cash bond outright.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental reason for **positive basis** (when CDS > bond spread $\\leftrightarrow$ when bonds are relatively expensive)\n",
    "- *CDS is efficient shorting mechanism for investors*: it is difficult to short cash bonds - and thus more people want to pay fixed to buy protection, propping up CDS spread. This effect is most apparent if there is negative news on a credit, it will tend to result in a flurry of protection buying in the CDS market thus increasing the CDS basis. \n",
    "    - This includes a case where the CDS/equities market leads the bonds market, which will render the basis reverting to mean.\n",
    "- *Risk of Technical Default*: Default swaps may be triggered by events which do not constitute a full default of the corresponding cash asset, e.g. Restructuring. This probably does not impact bond price, but takes a toll on the CDS spread.\n",
    "- *Cheapest to delivery option*: the standard CDS contract gives a protection buyer an option to choose a delivery instrument from a basket of deliverable securities in exchange of par from the protection seller in case of default; for this option, the protection buyer needs to pay more. \n",
    "    - It should be noted that the *modR* and *modmodR* clauses in the ISDA 2014 Credit Derivatives Definitions impose limitation on the maturity of the bonds deliverable. Since long-maturity bonds tend to be cheap when the name is in distress, modR and modmodR limits the cheapest-to-deliver option to some extend.\n",
    "- *CDS cannot go negative (for high rated credits)*: In the case of an asset swap or par floater, it is possible to show that if the credit quality of the issuer is better than AA-rated commercial banks, the spread over Libor paid by the bond may be negative. For example, it is possible to asset swap a US Treasury bond and find that the asset swap spread is negative. However, CDS spreads can never go negative as the protection seller is taking on the default risk of the reference entity and, though small, the probability of triggering can never be negative. The CDS spread must at the very least cover the administration costs of the CDS trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are also forces that will make the basis revert back to $0$**.\n",
    "- *Loss on default*: The protection payment on a CDS following a credit event is a fraction $(1 − R)$ of the face value of the contract. The default risk on a bond (or asset swap) purchased at a full price of $P$ is to a loss of $P − R$. \n",
    "     > If basis is negative, or bonds are cheap, i.e. $P<1$, then in the credit event the loss on bond will be small relative to CDS, and it makes bond more attrative relative to CDS, which will prop up the bond price, and basis will go up.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     > If basis is positive, or bonds are expensive, i.e. $P>1$, then in the credit event the loss on bond will be big relative to CDS, and it makes bond less attrative relative to CDS, which will push down the bond price, and basis will go down.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Essentially, this just mean that fractional recovery of par assumption (FRP) is forced upon traders during default; see the details of FRP in [this notebook](credit-models-and-analytics). The impact above is mitigated by considering the adjusted basis as desribed above. "

    "- On the bond side, IG premium corporate bond tends to have higher spreads than discounts, and whether a bond is premium or discount depends on the bond coupon and rates. At the maturtity increase, so is the dollar price of a premium bond, and this penalizing effect may be more apparent. However, using BCDS to define basis should be able to mitigate this effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the CDS side, Shorter-maturity CDS generally trade with a negative upfront (pay an upfront amount and then receive 100bp when selling protection), whereas the longer-maturity CDS contract is likely to trade with a positive upfront, making it more attractive for protection sellers from a funding perspective, suppressing the CDS spread on the long end."
