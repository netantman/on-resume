    "## Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a parsimonious, joint model for interest-rate trees and parametric model of default term-structure, and use BVAL prices to calibrate for both vol and credit spread parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Methodology\n",
    "- For any given volatility, one can build an interest-rate (short-rate) tree like the usual OAS model, **taking all other parameters as the swaption one except for the vol (e.g. mean-reversion speed in Black-Karacinski)**. \n",
    "- Overlay this interest rate tree with the **survival probability by the exponential spline** (see this [notebook](../../fixed-income/instruments/gsac/credit-pricing-and-analytics.ipynb)), we can then discount that cashflow in that branch (scenario), and further PV the bond for the whole tree. \n",
    "- PV is thus a function of the credit parameters (exponential spline) and interest rate vol, and we can **solve for an interest rate vol that matches the PV to the bond price**.\n",
    "    - A somewhat more detailed description of the optimization algorithm is, for any fixed interest rate vol, the PV is a linear function of the exponential spline parameters. Thus given the vol, **solving for the exponential spline coefficients matching PV to bond prices is again solving a linear regression**.\n",
    "    - After obtaining the minimal pricing errors in the regression above, we have a **one-dimensional pricing-error function** of interest rate vol, which is easy to optimize as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Difficulty\n",
    "**Data are uneven cross-sectionally**, in that some issuers may have more bonds and more liquid observations - apparently this methodology does not apply to all issuers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response\n",
    "We confined ourselves to **a few HY active issuers (such as CHTR)**, and **rating-level volatility calibration for munis** - in fact, we advertised BVAL is going to produce for AAA 5% the bullet curve."

    "## Resolution\n",
    "- Clients love the notion and it is on track to become BVAL's new income source.\n",
    "- But actually, from a hedging perspective, marking implied vol is probably less useful; one should try to **imply the issuer's effective call prices on each call date**.\n",
    "    - The peculiar constraints that issuers have in calls, that are othogonal to pure interest-rate economics, will **manifest in the implied call prices, rather than in interest rate** - the implied call prices thus have better economic meaning.\n",
    "    - Once the payoffs of the contigent claim of the call option is determined by the implied call prices, the **hedging should be more precise**; see also relating issue in this [notebook](../cds-bond-basis/basis-callable.ipynb)."
