    "    - Usually distressed names tend to widen and flatten.\n",
    "    - There is the idea of **empirical beta for CDS curve trades**: curves widening for names without short-term debts tends to steepens first and then flatten, i.e. the long-end lead the short-end change.\n",
    "- Yet another way to view this is to **time the default**. \n",
    "    - For example, if a name does not have short-term debt, it is not going to default in the short tenor, and safe to do steepener trade.\n",
    "- Another variant of this is to **sell CDS protection on both short- and long-end**: think of this as the barbell strategy as in cash bonds, though it is expressed in CDS. As the barbell strategy, it will benefit when convexity rises; see a more detailed description in Chapter 29 of [Morgan Stanley Credit Insights](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s191/nl/21353936/35eb5274-fadd-cea2-f38a-9275ffa755f7?title=Morgan%20Stanley%20Credit%20Insights%20(2015)) and Chapter 30 for an example on how a view is expressed."

    "- One way is to sell $(T+\\tau)$-yr CDS and buy $T$-yr CDS spot, i.e a spot flattener. \n",

    "- Another way is to sell $(T+\\tau)$-yr CDS now and buy $T$-yr protection back in $\\tau$ years, i.e. legging into positions. \n",
    "    - In this way, we are essentially selling a $\\tau$-yr CDS spot, and thus can be considered as alternative implementation of such trade.\n",
    "    - Another way to look at this is we are **earning the rolldown of the CDS curve**: after $\\tau$ years, the $T$-yr protection negative carry should be less than the positive carry from the earlier $(T+\\tau)$ position. Note that the carry will manifest in upfront rather than cash carry, with standard contracts. \n",
    "    - More specifically, if the credit curve is steep and the view is it is not going to flatten a lot in $\\tau$ years, the legging-into-position could earn more upfront than the outright $\\tau$-yr one (You can actually do similar things in IRS too)."

The degree is called absorbing factor.\n",
