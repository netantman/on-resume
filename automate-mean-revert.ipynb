    "We want to automate the screening and trading bound-setting process.\n",
    "- **Motivation**: After all necessary attributions, and PnL are **driven by round trip traffic of mean-reverting signals**: the more we can do round trips, the more profit we can generate. Thus we need to find those signals that are most mean-reverting quickly.\n",

    "Look for simple metrics from classic time-series analysis, and draw from reinforcement learning.\n",
    "- **Hurst exponent**: $<0.5$ is mean-reverting, and the smaller it is, the more mean-reverting.\n",
    "    - Based on **variance test**, which says that the time-series is more mean-reverting when the **variance as a function of lag $\\tau$ increase sub-linearly for $\\tau$**.\n",
    "    - To recall, **standard Brownian motion's variance grows linearly with lag $\\tau$**.\n",
    "- **Half life of OU process**:\n",
    "    - Similar to the [ADF](../../other-quant-methods/time-series-models.ipynb) test, **regress the change of time-series on $T-1$ value**. \n",
    "    - If the slope $\\lambda$ is **very negative**, it means mean revertion is strong.\n",
    "    - Formally, the **half life** of fitting the OU process is $-2/\\log(\\lambda)$, the shorter it is, the more mean-reverting.\n",
    "- **N-Armed Bandit**\n",
    "    - Simplest reinforcement setting.\n",
    "    - You can think of it as an AI learning how to trade, by observing the historical time-series and rewarded the PnL of the trade.\n",
    "        - Policy: the pre-defined trading bands that the algo can choose from\n",
    "        - Reward: Pnl\n",
    "        - Model: describes how the agent decide the next move and next reward - remained to be a black box for me for now.\n",
    "    - The result from one case-study is interesting: the algo is able to generate a 'kinked' trading schedule."
