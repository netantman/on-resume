    "## Situation and Task\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: There are **inversions** to the BVAL corp and muni prices **along the curve**\n",
    "- **Background**: \n",
    "    - The pricing model reacts to different bonds **in different speed**\n",
    "        - For bonds just traded, the pricing algo quickly captures and the traded price will be reflected in the output.\n",
    "        - For a similar bonds that are not traded/quotes, their prices stay relatively unchanged in some cases.\n",
    "        - Thus when **an issuer get repricing**, inversions can occurs, e.g. the short-end bond gets cheapens rapidly, while the long-end bond stays put.\n",
    "    - Human needs to **adjust the prices manually**, which is **time-consuming** and **error-prone**. Moreover, lacking a monitoring system, such adjustments only occurs **after the client challenges**. \n",
    "- **Task**: To build an automatic system to correct for such blatant inconsistencies."

    "## Action\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial response**: a more systematic way is perhaps **enhancing/fixing the pricing algo itself**. But that may take a long time while the thread is imminent.\n",
    "- **Further difficulty**: one **cannot adjust bonds locally**, \n",
    "    - e.g. only cheapening a 3yr bond due to a 2yr bond cheapening may cause inversion between the 3yr bond and the 5yr bond;\n",
    "    - but we do not want to move everythiung longer than 2yr all up, so there is a compromise to make.\n",
    "    - This also shows **why human correction can sometimes be difficult**.\n",
    "- **Solution**: Take all bonds of the same curve into consideration and **run a convex optimization to solve for the optimal adjustment amounts**\n",
    "    - **linear constraints**: the pair of bonds should not be inverted after adjustments\n",
    "    - **quadratic, or squared loss**: a cost is incurred by the **squared of the adjustment amount**, and **heavier costs can be assigned to bonds that we are really relunctant to move** by specification of the loss function. \n",
    "    - Convex optimization **runs quickly**, and has **existing numerical package** we can leverage."

    "## Resolution\n",
    "- **Achievements**: Inversion are corrected, automatically, before they are shown to clients; it saved evaluators great amount of time correcting for the inversion or dealing with client complaint.\n",
    "- **Take-away**: **I am good at, and enjoying problem solving formulating the business problem into a maths or modeling problem**."
