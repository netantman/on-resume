    "- **Task**: find a systematic way to stablize empirical delta\n",
    "- **Background**\n",
    "    - **Empirical delta** is the **rolling regression slope** regressing **bond price point change** onto **equity price change**: it is the empirical version of a hedge ratio between bond notional and eq investment amount, which is why it is point change for bond price and percentage change for eq price.\n",
    "    - **Matching model delta with empirical delta** is one test that we can run to ascertain the correctness (or market-implied values) of model inputs such as recovery and debt-per-share.\n",
    "- **Problem**\n",
    "    - The empirical delta, being a rolling correlation metric, is **very volatile historically** to be a meaningful benchmark.\n",
    "    - Whenever the $R^2$ of the above regression is low, we want a systematic way to **fall back to user's view** where extremely safe names has high single-digit to low teen delta, while safe distressed name $20-35\\%$."

    "\n",
    "This is a perfect situation where **Bayesian regression** can be used.\n",
    "- Bayesian regression is to specify **Gaussian-inverse-Gamma** conjugate prior on regression coefficient and standard deviations.\n",
    "- The posterior mean of the slope is a nice **shrinkage between prior mean and the OLS estimator**\n",
    "- If we set the hyperparameters of the prior to be depending on the $R^2$ of the classical regression, i.e. in a somewhat **empirical Bayes** fashion, we have the posterior automatically compromising OLS estimate against user's view (prior)."

    "\n",
    "- Prior or the shrinkage serve as an anchorage, which **stablizes the time series** and reduces historical variation by $37\\%$.\n",
    "- What is more, the time series of empirical delta now stablizes **towards the user's expected value**, which is a good feature."

    "- As such, it suffices to just set $\\mu_0$ to be user anticipated delta value, and $\\Lambda_0$ to be $\\frac{1}{(R^2)^p}X^{\\top}X$, where $p$ is a lever we can pull to determine how aggressive the fallback should be."
