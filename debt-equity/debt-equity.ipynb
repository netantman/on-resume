    "> **Expressing views** A capital structure arbitrage portfolio manager considers all securities of a company (debt and equity) for possible mispricing or relative mispricing. They view the securities by payment priority against current cash and future earnings potential. They assess value by ascertaining probabilistic ability to pay debt obligations as well as potential realized equity valuation. Capital structure arbitrage is an investment strategy that is flexible and broad enough in scope to accommodate opportunities that arise throughout the credit cycle, by going up or down the cap structure at different times of the credit cycle.\n",

    "> **Implementation Details** \n",
    "\n",
    ">> The classical trade is probably long-short equity/equity derivative vs CDS spread. In a model-driven way, the [structural model](../models/structural-credit-models.ipynb) is used to calibrate the asset volatility, survival probability and synthetic CDS spread, which can be used to compare to actual observed CDS spread. Some studies of this strategy can be found in these [papers](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s191/nl/21353936/f718aa0d-09b4-434d-827f-21e6abd9d96f).\n",
    "\n",
    ">> The simplest implementation of this trade is to long on one rank and short the other rank, e.g. short company stock and long debt, either by long the bonds or sell protection.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Each of these securities in each layer can be expected to have unique volatility characteristics. The more junior a security, the more likely it will be relatively more volatile. The portfolio manager must consider this volatility when positioning long and short as this will affect the overall P&L volatility exposure to their portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> The portfolio manager must evaluate the covenants of outstanding debt and ascertain payment priority, which can be complicated. The most difficult layer of complication comes from companies with multiple subsidiaries. Subsidiaries and holding companies may have cross-liabilities and not be entirely self-reliant. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> Often the capital structure arbitrage portfolio can be concentrated by sector as industry dynamics can affect multiple companies at once in a way that creates opportunity uniquely to that sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Risks and Hedges** \n",
    "\n",
    ">> The long and short legs of the trade can both go against you. \n",
    "     \n",
    "   >>> For instance, in 2005, Boaz Weinstein's GM trade involves shorting the stock and selling bond protection of GM (equivalently longing the bond). But in the summar, the trade got burned when there was a rumor of acquisition which pumps up stock price, while at the same time that GM was downgraded which decreases the value of the CDS. \n",
    "   \n",
    ">> Even if the two legs do not diverge further, they can still stay diverged long enough so that the long-short positions bleed due to carry cost\n",
    "\n",
    ">> A good credit model is required - think the pre-Crisis credit correlation modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Hedging in this strategy tends to be company specific, whether on a junior or senior security basis. However, it is usual to see industry level hedges or even index based ones in this strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> Capital structure arbitrage portfolios can have a tendency to be net long for the company specific positions. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> Other more generalized hedging techniques may often make sense to deploy in order to mitigate overall market beta/duration exposures. In a sense, the risk that we want to be exposed to is the idio correlation of different instruments under the same issuer/parent; a statistical study that could be useful in this regard is this [paper](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s191/nl/21353936/149ccd7c-70e9-c122-6287-135407f102ed?title=Bloomberg%20Fixed%20Income%20Risk%20Model%20-%20Enhanced%20Model%20of%20Idiosyncratic%20Return%20Correlation)."
